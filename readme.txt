This is a demo implementation for our dehazing paper in ECCV16.

This test code is based on the MatConvNet toolbox. 
You should compile MatConvNet first on your computer then use the "demo_MSCNNdehazing.m" to test on your images.

The current published compliled version in the folder "MSCNN_dehazing\matlab" can be directly use on a Win7 computer.
